## ðŸŒ¹ Hi, Iâ€™m Rosa!

Iâ€™m a Frontend Software Engineer based in the NYC metro area and have officially been building for the web since 2016 (though what I dabble in outside of work doesnâ€™t always fit that label).

Outside of code, I enjoy diamond painting, watching youtube videos, and browsing vintage stores.

Thanks for stopping by (ï¾‰â—•ãƒ®â—•)ï¾‰*:ï½¥ï¾Ÿâœ§
